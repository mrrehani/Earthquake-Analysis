## Description
In this project, we worked to extract insights for a presentation using data from a novel source: specifically, we focused on shifts in the earthquake magnitude over the years. Preliminary background research suggested the average magnitude of earthquakes has increased since 2004. 

### Technologies Used:
- Tidyverse
